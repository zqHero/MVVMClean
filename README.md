Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `./gradlew clean build` - Build the entire example and execute unit and integration tests plus lint check.
 * `./gradlew installDebug` - Install the debug apk on the current connected device.
 * `./gradlew runUnitTests` - Execute domain and data layer tests (both unit and integration).
 * `./gradlew runAcceptanceTests` - Execute espresso and instrumentation acceptance tests.
